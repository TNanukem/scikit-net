The sknet project is a scikit-learn compatible framework for machine learning in complex networks. It provides learning algorithms for complex networks, as well as transforming methods to turn tabular data into complex networks.

It started in 2021 as a project from volunteers to help to improve the development of research on the interface between complex networks and machine learning.
